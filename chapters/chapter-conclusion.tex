In discussing results, the first thing to note is that
a quantum computer sure would have been useful in actually
performing this simulation.
As Feynman noted\cite{Feynman:82}, simulating a quantum system
by a classical computer requires an exponentially large amount
of overhead.  This was clearly evident in this research.
However, the work must be done.  Decoherence and the 
experimental control and manipulation of different 
physical devices introduce noise into a computation.  
How much noise can the computation withstand before
it fails?  Exactly how does a computation fail in the
presence of various types of noise?
Any means of getting a handle
on the stability of these algorithms warrants attention.

The current work uses a numerical simulation of
a dynamical description of Grover's quantum search
algorithm to determine the answers to some of these
questions.

\section{The Effects of Noise on Grover's Algorithm}

\begin{itemize}
\item Noise does not slow the algorithm down.  It only reduces the
probability that the algorithm will succeed.  This is shown in 
figure \ref{fig:humps}.
\item The maximum amount of noise that the algorithm can tolerate,
the point at which the probability of success falls below $\frac{1}{2}$,
scales as $\lbrace\text{number of qubits}\rbrace^{-3}$.  This is shown in
figure \ref{fig:results}
%, and falls at a somewhat faster rate than 
%previous results (with a much simpler model)\cite{Pablo-Norman/Ruiz-Altaba:99}
%imply.
\end{itemize}

\caption{Probability of success -v- time for different noise levels and different numbers
of qubits.  Black is a run without noise, red is the same run with noise.  Notice that
where the peaks occur in ``time'' do not change due to noise.  The relative times of the
peaks are artificial in this graph.}

%y = 0.58123479 N^{-2.886221}

Appendix \ref{chap:data} contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item Bures-v-time for different noise levels and different numbers of qubits.
%\item Probability of success -v- time for different noise levels and different numbers
%of qubits.
\item maximum probability of success -v- noise level for given number of qubits.
\item maximum probability of success -v- number of qubits for given noise levels.
\end{itemize}

%Want the max allowed noise so that maximum target coefficient is still above 
%$\frac{1}{2}$.  Really want max allowed noise so that the algorithm is still
%better (faster?) than the classical version.  How does this whole
%$P_{\text{cutoff}}$ thing work?

\subsection{Physical Implications}

\begin{itemize}
\item Give an example where the physical noise ends up as noise
in the state vector... should be easy.
\item How does noise in a gate propagate out?
\end{itemize}
