This dissertation is organized as follows:  Chapters \ref{chap:quantumComputation}
and \ref{chap:quantumAlgorithms} contain background information on quantum computation
and quantum algorithms.
%These chapters are essentially from\cite{Preskill:98,Steane:98,Braunstein:99,Shor:00}
%and are included for completeness.  
Chapter \ref{chap:quantumGeometry} describes the
Fubini--Study metric and relates this to a statistical distance in Hilbert space.

The meat of the current work lies in the remaining chapters.  
Chapter \ref{chap:dynamics} applies the Fubini--Study  metric to a dynamical 
model of a particular quantum algorithm, namely Grover's quantum search algorithm.  
Chapter \ref{chap:dynamicalStability} introduces the
necessary techniques for numerical stability analysis that are then applied to
the model of Grover's algorithm in the presence of noise. 
Finally, chapter \ref{chap:code} discusses aspects of the numerical model and the 
tools used in this analysis. \mmm{put this in an appendix??}
