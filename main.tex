\index{Acknowledgments@\emph{Acknowledgments}}
I'd like to thank Professor Sudarshan, not only 
for his encouragement and diligent tutelage, but for his 
infinite patience during my brief flirtation with 
``applied capitalism'' in the midst of my education.

Many thanks go to Professor C\'ecile DeWitt for taking
me under her wing as an undergraduate, and for 
continuing guidance and support over the years.

Thanks to my family and friends for
their generous support and patience throughout.

Many people have contributed in one way or another
to this work.
